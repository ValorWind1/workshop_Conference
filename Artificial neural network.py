Artificial neural networks ( ANN) / connectionist systems.

computing systems INSPIRED by the biological neural networks of animal brains.

This is NOT AN ALGORITHM, but a FRAMEWORK. that allows machine learning algorithm
to work together, and process its complex data inputs.

The systems learns to perform tasks by considering scenarios/examples.

(ANN) it's based on a COLLECTION of CONNECTED NODES called ( artificial neurons)
, model the neurons in a real/biological brain.

each synapses/connection like in a biological brain trasmists a signal from one
artifical neuron to another. Which another artifical neuron receives this signal
and proccess it.

implementations of the signal at a connection between artifical neurons is a real
number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by a non linear function
that sums of its inputs.
